# Welcome to the FQ Website project!

This project in no way reflects the status of the organization Fantasy Quest, and is in no way meant
to be a legitimate source of information for Fantasy Quest as an organization
and is purely intended to be a reflection on the updating of the website itself.

Please visit the actual Fantasy Quest website at www.fantasyquest.org to see the actual reflected
status of the organization as well as any other potential organization updates.

The intended use of this project is purely to update the website and experiment with different features
and collaborate with other engineers/developers as well as demonstrating the look and feel
to the Fantasy Quest staff.

The website itself is being hosted from the /main branch and will recieve periodic updates from this branch
which is intended to be the most up-to-date reflection of the project.
